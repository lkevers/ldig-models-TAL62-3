eng	 more people came to the party than i had bargained for . jobs are hard to come by with so many people out of work . anyone would find it hard to run on such a hot day . with it raining like this , we'll never be able to leave . this is the first time i've seen such a dreadful movie . you should not climb the mountain in such bad weather . this is the most exciting book that i have ever read . i'm really glad to have had such an enjoyable time . what a good scholar the author must be to write such a splendid book ! i had no idea it would put you to so much trouble . she must be kind - hearted to send you such a pretty doll . you had better not wander around here by yourself . i never expected this fine hotel to be found in such a place . who wants to be cooped up indoors on a nice day like this ? it is very kind of you to send me such a nice present . you may not believe this , but i don't drink at all . please accept what little comfort these words can give you . you might not believe what i'm about to tell you , so don't be surprised . it is criminal to pay so much money for such trifles . it's a pity for you to have to stay indoors in this weather . you must put up with your new post for the present . i hurt my eye when my contact slipped out of place . the concert starts at seven . we must not be late . the concert was held over till the following week because of the singer's illness . it was lucky that we got the tickets for the concert . i had to leave the theatre in the middle of the concert . i noticed several people sleeping during the concert . i had difficulty getting a ticket for the concert . those present at the concert were surprised by his performance . i absolutely love going to concerts not just because i get a chance to meet the musician or singer but because of the wondrous feeling of a live performance . i'll be back in thirty minutes so i'll be in time for the concert . i was surprised to see so many people at the concert . i want to talk to the famous pianist before his concert . i was surprised because the concert ended all too soon . concrete can be reinforced by putting steel bars inside it . columbus argued that he could reach india by going west . columbus sailed farther west to look for a new continent . we learned that columbus discovered america in 1492 . if you continue to remain silent , i'll lose my temper . it'll be a waste of time if we wait for them any longer . it's an absolute waste of time to wait any longer . a further reduction would make us go into the red . if you request a further discount , we suggest changing the terms of payment . if you buy this , i will give you a fifteen percent discount . how many days will it take if i send this as registered mail ? please send me a reply as soon as you receive this mail . let's try to settle our differences once and for all . turn this to the right , and the machine will start . the best way to do this is to have all the presents collected in one place until everyone has arrived . there is none other than you to whom i can leave this .
eng	 of these two opinions , i prefer the latter to the former . if we take this additional evidence into consideration , the second law must be modified . the latter will continue to develop along their own paths according to the needs of their own speakers . these are not sufficient reasons for breaking the promise . there are dangers that threaten both men and women . all these are ways of exceeding the bounds imposed on us by human nature . these tales have been passed on from generation to generation . these stories are told in colloquial and everyday language . instead of laying off these workers , why don't we just cut their hours ? the optimal formula which would encompass all these factors has not been proposed . we must not allow these problems to affect the project . these problems have arisen as a result of indifference . these problems have arisen as the result of your carelessness . what kinds of changes are needed to address these problems ? as these trees grow tall , they rob the grass of light . you can borrow these books from the library for a week . of all these books , this is by far the best on china . these convenient goods will meet our customers' demands . it is out of the question to learn all these sentences by heart . i would like to know how these substances are absorbed by the body . these goods are greater in quantity than in quality . the teacher said we had to learn all these expressions by heart . these specimens are divided into several categories . these ungrammatical sentences resulted from the application of the additional rule f . take home these paintings of his and tell me what you think of them . thanks to these discoveries , man's life span has become twice as long as before . if these days are not convenient for you , please let us know . about 14 , 000 of these usually have tickets for the center court . these legends should be handed down to our offspring . there points can be brought under the same heading . people in these areas are growing hungrier each year . could you teach me how people distinguish between these words in common usage ? these bags are very heavy , so carry one bag at a time . these sea boats are fast enough to stay in a depression for several days . these creatures evolved from simpler organisms like jellyfish . these figures indicate three in five college first - year students are indifferent to politics . these diagrams demonstrate different possible approaches to job seeking . it is not unreasonable to think that these people were excluded from the community . what accounts for these symptoms hasn't been discovered yet . i'd like you to quickly look over these documents . with respect to these documents , i think the best thing is to destroy them . with respect to these letters , i think the best thing is to burn them . these automobiles , for the most part , are manufactured in japan . these watches are more expensive than the ones in that case . these countries settled the dispute among themselves . european civilization had its birth in these lands .
eng	 many of these words we are unable to recall at will . these old customs have been handed down from generation to generation . none of these plans ever come anywhere near realization . the verdict at issue in these discussions is the one brought in the lander's trial in 1994 . these regulations ought to be observed by the students . these rules have been and always will be observed . these poor people were at the mercy of the cruel dictator . these infections were caused by contaminated milk . for these patients , surgical treatment is far from being satisfactory . these paintings were handed down to me from my father . these fragile items must be insured against all risks . these meetings are carried on entirely in english . these houses were burnt down to the ground by the enemy . it is most important to emphasize that none of these processes are conscious . we'll do away with all these silly rules as soon as we can . his ambition was blasted by these repeated failures . we need to postulate a completely different paradigm to explain all these phenomena . their hypothesis is that these strategies may come into conflict with emmet's theory . he will learn these things not so much from what the other man says as from how he says it . note the function of the background layers of these graphic designs . these elevators are each capable of carrying ten persons . it is not enough to show that these two particles are moving at different speed . there may be other factors that intervene in the relation between these two constants . all of these sports and many others are dominated by the human urge to aim at something . these are the trees on the leaves of which silkworms live . these two lines cut across each other at right angles . can you tell the difference between these two pictures ? would you show me a less expensive camera than this one ? again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news . you have to make good the time you have wasted so far . in all my career as a travel agent , i never visited africa . we have all been talking about tomorrow ; now let's come down to earth and talk about today . in all my travels i've never seen a more beautiful mountain than everest . never in my life have i thought of leaving the town . so far i have been getting along well with my friends . our company has never had that kind of system , and it's never made us feel uncomfortable . in the past i used to vote for the democratic ticket , but from now on i'll climb on the republican bandwagon . so far we have had no news as to which route the expedition has taken . in the past i used to vote the democratic ticket , but from now on i'll climb on the republicans' bandwagon . for once in my life i succeeded in getting the better of him . i've never heard of such a frightening story before . in honor of all the hard work we raised a toast to our first day in our new home ! never have i seen a more beautiful sight than this . certainly there is nothing that will separate people more , and nothing so easy to slip into .
eng	 never before have we had such a strong longing for peace . this is the house which was designed by a famous architect . this is a useful book and , what is more , it is not expensive . how is it that otherwise reasonable people come to believe that this same roof , that practically vanishing commodity , is freely obtainable just by packing up and going to another country ? please accept this as a keep - sake of my husband . this is her t - shirt . that t - shirt is hers , too . this is something she has done since she was a child . this was the most interesting book that she had ever read . this is what they have in common with other peoples . this may be because they could not use the earth's magnetic field . this is the house in which they lived when they were children . this is by far the most interesting of his novels . this is by far the most interesting of all his novels . this is a socio - linguistic study on the japanese language . this is because of the difference between japanese politeness and american politeness . this is a secret just between you and me , so don't let it slip out . this is a difficult problem , and it is not easy for anyone to decide . this is an argument material to the question in hand . this is the best indian restaurant anywhere in tokyo . this is the heaviest snowfall in thirty years in tokyo . this is a picture of the first train that ran between tokyo and yokohama . this is the pipeline which supplies the town with gas . this is such an easy problem that any student can solve it . this is considered to be a matter of great importance . this is the book that my teacher recommended to me . this is longer than any other bridge in the world . this is a direct broadcast from the showa theater . this is a writing style different from genuine english . this is a very important meeting . you ought not to miss it . since this is important , i'd like you to attend to it yourself . this is an interesting case where there is no principal determining element . this is a great time - saving gadget for the housewife . this is a map which will be useful when traveling by car . this is the spitting image of the real thing , perfectly true to life . this will be a good opportunity for me to use my language skills to my advantage . this enables me to see and face my present trouble . this is a proverb the meaning of which i don't know . here is a present for you in token of our appreciation . this is the same pencil that i lost the other day . this was the first japanese food i had ever tasted . this is the most interesting story that i have ever read . this is the most wonderful present i have ever received . this is the tallest building that i have ever seen . this is the most massive structure i have ever seen . this is what my mother gave me when i got married . this is the same type of camera as the one i lost . they say this is one of the best books , if not the best . this is by far the best novel that has been published this year . this is the most beautiful sight that i have ever seen .
eng	 the problem is one of interpreting these ancient scriptures . this will go down in history as the greatest event that has ever taken place . let's just keep this between ourselves , shall we ? this is a good book for anyone wishing to learn english . this sees english as a system obeying miles of grammar and sentence structure which have to be learned in detail and applied rigorously . this is a layer of soil that is permanently frozen , and in some places it's many feet deep . this is the largest tanker that has ever been constructed in our country . it only goes as far as main street , but you can get the number 31 there . this is mr miller's latest book , and we hope it will not be his last . this is such an easy problem as any student can solve . sure , this house is as good as ever . she's built so well we could move her anywhere . this is such an interesting story i will never forget it . this is very good ice cream . won't you have some ? this means that our perception of any situation depends only partly on sensory signals being received at that time . this is the pen which the famous novelist wrote with . this question must be discussed separately from that one . this is a socio - linguistic study on steven emmet . this is a precious chance to get sammy's autograph . this is the largest dictionary there is in this library . i don't think this is the box that this toy came in ; it won't fit in . this is a superb illustration of how emmet modified the traditional architectural designs . this is an example of the survival of the fittest , as it is called . this looks longer than that , but it is an optical illusion . this is what is called a 'present' in some countries and 'bribery' in others . this means that if you try to protect yourself too much , you will only make bigger mistakes . this movie is not anything like as exciting as that one . this is the sort of thing you have to account for . that is to say , their behavior seems to be against the rules made by adults . this means that others can only come to know you and like you by listening to what you say . this is the most beautiful of all the pictures in my album . this is a subject of which i know nothing whatever . this is the most beautiful lake that i have ever seen . this is the most beautiful sunset that i have ever seen . this is a great opportunity to increase our market share . this does not mean only the study of language , history or geography . this may be because of a change in people's attitude toward marriage and the sharp increase of fast food restaurants and convenience stores which are open 24 hours a day and enable young people to live more easily . this is so enduring as to make even the most diligent worker give up . this is the house in which the poet lived in his childhood . this was to arrange things so that i obtained the result already written in the textbooks . this note summarizes some information that we hope to discuss at the meeting in san francisco . the problem is one of determining the dominant factors in this phenomenon .
eng	 this only increased his desire to be revenged on the murderous duke . don't let this discourage you from trying it again . do you have anything to say in connection with this ? do any of you have anything to say in connection with this ? it includes widely varying organizations , people , and ideas . and as with so many aspects of british life , there's a good historical reason for it . in the same way , a russian might fail to see anything amusing in a joke which would make an englishman laugh to tears . i don't know if you'd call it a hobby , but to stretch it a little , you could say music appreciation is my hobby . this ought to bring in enough money to put us back in the black . it's like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders . you'll make the same mistake if things continue in this way . it will surely by useful for your future to put forth this much effort . there are so many anti - smoking campaigns these days ; maybe smoking really is a threat to the public order . i'm not afraid of anything after having verbal abuse heaped on me like that . in fact , i feel empowered by it . not bad — not bad at all . this is quite a gathering of talent to have under one roof . if you want to avoid cholesterol , eat lean meat with no fat . this is the same motorcycle that was left at the scene of the accident . this is the same car that was left at the scene of the crime . this is the very book that i have long wanted to read . this is the very dictionary i've been looking for . this is just what i have been looking for so long . this is the very place i have long wanted to visit . this is the very dictionary that i have wanted so long . this is the very dictionary that i have been looking for . here is a true israelite , in whom there is nothing false . isn't this the same necklace that aunt clara wears ? this is the hotel at which we stayed at that time . this is shorthand writing , by means of which we can keep up with the talker . this is the central problem of postwar immigration . this is the best dictionary there is in the library . is this in fact going to affect their relationships ? this is the house where my father was born and brought up . this is the ideology to which my speech is written . this is where we differ very much from japanese workers . this is the house in which i was born and brought up . this is the house where i lived when i was a child . this is a proverb the meaning of which i do not understand . there are photos of the singers who're featured in the magazine . this is the car about which linda talked yesterday . this is the dictionary i told you about yesterday . this is the letter sent from hong kong by air mail . this caused most of the local bath - houses to fall on hard times . so , this is the nata - de - coco that everyone is talking about . there'll be quite a lot of scenes like this in the next few programs . from now on , you must be responsible for what you do . i've decided to be more positive and give it all i've got . from now on , you'll have to take care of yourself .
eng	 this is the very camera i've wanted for a long time . this was the last conversation i had with my mother about terry tate . the shutter's over here . all you have to do is press it . this has been the trend for the past twenty years . this is the house where the famous novelist was born . i appreciate that this is not an easy task for you . this is the reason that she succeeded as a pop singer . this is the camera with which he took the picture . is this what you've been searching for all this time ? i've never played golf , but i think i'll give it a shot . when it comes to playing golf , you cannot beat him . researchers at the gorilla foundation have to spell out words like " c - a - n - d - y " and " g - u - m " when koko is nearby . gorillas cannot use their lips and tongues to speak , but they can communicate with people in other ways . she held him like mother gorillas hold their babies . i'm sorry to have troubled you . no matter what he may do , he will be praised . i feel terrible , but i've just broken your ashtray . i'm afraid you can't . i have tennis practice later . sorry i haven't fixed dinner tonight . i was so tired there was just no way . comedians base their jokes on tragic situations like violent death or serious accidents . getting rid of garbage has become a major headache for the authorities . as all kinds of communication methods are proliferating , human relationships are weakening . this is a perfect example of mistaking means for ends . there is a law against dropping litter but it is rarely enforced . it is necessary to put something by against days of need . copernicus taught that the earth moves around the sun . copernicus proposed the idea that the earth travels around the sun . i'm looking forward to the day when miss cobb comes back , i can tell you . the only person who's looking forward to miss cobb's return . she'll be seeing to your correspondence while miss cobb's away . jane cobb , his present secretary , is the only person in the office who can stand him . the obsequious waiter is usually assigned the best table because he always curries favor with his manager and superiors . a campaign is underway throughout the company to achieve economy in the use of copying paper . nothing could be more useful than a copying machine . this rose does not smell so sweet as the one i bought the other day . this watch was handed down to me by my grandfather . i'm afraid the story will give him a wrong impression . this story might sound unbelievable but it is true . as i heard the story secondhand , i can't ascertain the truth of it . this story is by far more interesting than that one . this story may sound strange , but it's absolutely true . as to the source of this statement , i know nothing . the lesson of this story is not that reading shakespeare will help one rise in the business world . the paper discusses the problem in terms of ethics . the essay treats of the progress of cancer research . we are not concerned in this paper with the application of emmet's theory in biology .
eng	 in this paper i limit the discussion to emmet's 'dyad' style in his works from 1995 . in this paper , i compare the folklores of germany and holland . in the first section of this review i raise the question of how brain processes cause our conscious experiences . this exercise is easy enough for me to do without help . this pair of lovers were carrying on an ardent correspondence . this train left aomori thirty minutes late , so we won't arrive at tokyo before noon , i'm afraid . this train makes connections with a ferry - boat at takamatsu . take this train and make a change at the next station . this history book is written for high school students . how many minutes shall i boil this frozen asparagus ? the example doesn't fall into any type stated above . in this instance we are provided with an exact account of the conversation between the two poets . this beam won't hold the weight of the second story . the outdoor spa at this hot - spring is wonderful . this theory is too difficult for me to comprehend . for this reason , the credibility of the book's authors rests on the credibility of their sources . i decided to visit the united states on this account . this medicine will ensure you a good night's sleep . please fill in your name and address on this form . this oil field used to produce an order of magnitude more oil as it does now . this medicine will do you good or harm , as the case may be . take this medicine faithfully , and you will feel better . this medicine will cure you of your stomach - ache . you can get rid of the cold if you take this medicine . this medicine will cure your headache immediately . take this medicine , and you'll feel a lot better . you should ask a physician for his advice before taking this medicine . what effect did the doctor say this medicine has on people ? this medicine must not be placed within the reach of children . this poison is very effective in getting rid of roaches . this medicine , properly used , will do you a lot of good . no one can say for sure how this awkward state of affairs came about . let's approach this problem from a different angle . i'll give you five minutes to work out this problem . it took me a couple of hours to solve this problem . i will give you ten minutes to work out this problem . it is difficult , if not impossible , to solve this problem . the two countries came to a political settlement over this dispute . this problem is too difficult for primary school children to solve . this problem is hard to solve . so you had better begin with that one . something must be done immediately to deal with this problem . this problem can not be discussed here for lack of time . this problem is too simple , so it is hardly worth discussing . i can't solve this problem . it's too difficult for me . this problem seems to be easy on the surface , but it's really difficult . this was too difficult a problem for her to solve . this problem arose from a mutual misunderstanding . this problem is not so difficult that you can't solve it .
