eng	for some reason i feel more alive at night .
eng	it depends on the context .
eng	are you freaking kidding me ? !
eng	that's the stupidest thing i've ever said .
eng	i don't want to be lame ; i want to be cool ! !
eng	when i grow up , i want to be a king .
eng	i'm so fat .
eng	so what ?
eng	i'm gonna shoot him .
eng	i'm not a real fish , i'm just a mere plushy .
eng	i'm just saying !
eng	that was probably what influenced their decision .
eng	this is what i would have said .
eng	that's because you're a girl .
eng	sometimes i can't help showing emotions .
eng	it's a word i'd like to find a substitute for .
eng	it would be something i'd have to program .
eng	i don't intend to be selfish .
eng	let's consider the worst that could happen .
eng	how many close friends do you have ?
eng	this is always the way it has been .
eng	i think it is best not to be impolite .
eng	one can always find time .
eng	i'd be unhappy , but i wouldn't kill myself .
eng	when i woke up , i was sad .
eng	that is somewhat explained at the end .
eng	i thought you liked to learn new things .
eng	most people write about their daily life .
eng	in order to do that , you have to take risks .
eng	why do you ask ?
eng	how long did you stay ?
eng	maybe it will be exactly the same for him .
eng	innocence is a beautiful thing .
eng	humans were never meant to live forever .
eng	i think i have a theory about that .
eng	that is intriguing .
eng	i do not have an account in these forums .
eng	i didn't know where it came from .
eng	this is not important .
eng	i didn't like it .
eng	she's asking how that's possible .
eng	you're just running away from life's problems .
eng	there's a problem there that you don't see .
